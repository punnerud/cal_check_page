# CalCheck - Calendar Sync Verification App

## Full Product Description

CalCheck is an innovative iOS application designed to solve a common but often overlooked problem: verifying that your calendar is actually syncing properly across all your devices. In our increasingly connected world, we rely on calendar synchronization to keep our schedules consistent across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other devices. However, sync failures can occur silently, leaving you unaware that your calendar updates aren't reaching all your devices until it's too late.

## The Problem CalCheck Solves

Have you ever added an important meeting to your calendar on your iPhone, only to discover later that it never appeared on your iPad or Mac? Or worse, have you missed an appointment because a calendar update didn't sync properly? Traditional calendar apps don't provide any way to verify that synchronization is actually working - they simply assume it is. CalCheck fills this critical gap by providing active verification that your calendar sync is functioning correctly.

## How CalCheck Works

### The Sync Verification Method

CalCheck uses a clever and non-intrusive approach to verify calendar synchronization:

1. **Test Event Creation**: CalCheck creates a single, harmless test event in your selected calendar, positioned 14 days in the past where it won't clutter your current view.

2. **Automatic Updates**: Every 2 hours (or on-demand), CalCheck updates this test event with fresh timestamp information.

3. **Cross-Device Detection**: When CalCheck is installed on multiple devices, each instance can detect the test events created by other devices, confirming that sync is working bidirectionally.

4. **Smart Cleanup**: The app maintains only one test event per device, automatically removing old events to keep your calendar clean.

5. **Background Monitoring**: With background sync enabled, CalCheck works silently to verify your calendar is syncing even when you're not actively using the app.
